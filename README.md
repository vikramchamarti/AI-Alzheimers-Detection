## 🚀 Application Overview

This advanced AI application uses deep learning to analyze MRI brain scans and detect different stages of Alzheimer's disease with high accuracy and beautiful visualizations.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🔍 Real-time Analysis**: Upload MRI images for instant AI-powered classification
- **📊 Advanced Visualizations**: Interactive charts, gauges, and confidence metrics
- **🎯 Multi-stage Detection**: Identifies 4 different Alzheimer's stages:
  - **Non Demented** (Healthy brain function)
  - **Very Mild Demented** (Early stage with minimal decline)
  - **Mild Demented** (Noticeable cognitive impairment)
  - **Moderate Demented** (Significant cognitive decline)
- **📈 Confidence Scoring**: Detailed prediction confidence with visual indicators
- **🎨 Stunning UI**: Professional interface with gradients and animations
- **🧠 Clinical Insights**: Medical guidance and next steps recommendations

### 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit with custom CSS styling
- **Backend**: TensorFlow/Keras deep learning model
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts and gauges
- **Image Processing**: PIL for MRI image preprocessing
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Upload**: Choose an MRI brain scan image (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
2. **Analyze**: Click the "🔍 Analyze Image" button
3. **Results**: View detailed predictions with:
   - Primary prediction with confidence level
   - Interactive confidence charts
   - Gauge visualization
   - Alternative predictions
